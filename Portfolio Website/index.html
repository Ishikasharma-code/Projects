    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am Ishika Sharma, currently pursuing B.Tech (2022–2026) from Galgotias University. I am passionate about frontend development, coding, and solving real-world problems through technology.
     From frontend to backend, I thrive on solving complex problems with clean, efficient code. My expertise spans React, Next.js, and Node.js, and I'm always eager to learn more.

When I'm not immersed in work, I'm exploring new ideas and staying curious. Life's about balance, and I love embracing every part of it.

I believe in waking up each day eager to make a difference!</p>
